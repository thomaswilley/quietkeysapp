Developer comment:

This license may change at any time. If it does change, it's
likely to be less restrictive. The rationale for providing this source code
openly is to protect user privacy - not to encourage further community
development (although pull requests are welcome).

The developer believes applications like QuietKeys - which hook into end-user
input devices (keyboard and microphone in this case) - should be open sourced
at a minimum in this manner (if not less restrictively!) so source code can be
inspected directly by users and modified for their own personal benefit at a
minimum. A motivation for the restritiveness is that the Software is also a
test use case for https://increment.me and includes a link within the
Software for users to provide feedback - and this protective license ensures that any
feedback provided is associated with the Software as intended.

***Obtain a custom License or share Feedback: If you would like to provide
feedback on QuietKeys including on it's license,
or obtain a custom license for your needs - please do! I'd welcome hearing from
you and the best way to do so is to provide your information through the
QuietKeys topic on Increment at:
