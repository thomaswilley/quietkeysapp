# Installation

You can either compile QuietKeys yourself or download the latest QuietKeysApp.exe from /Release.
If you'd like to compile it, grab a free copy of Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, make sure to install it with C/C++ compilation features, and open up QuietKeysApp.sln and hit F5 to build.

If you'd like to set it to always run at startup, it takes 10 seconds following these 3 steps from Microsoft.com:

# Other similar software

I'm aware of two other similar apps - neither work on windows, ergo - QuietKeys.
https://kryogenix.org/code/hushboard/ for Linux
https://unclack.app/ for Mac OS

And then there are fancier apps like https://krisp.ai/ that do more if you need it.
QuietKeys is simple, and free.
