QuietKeys is a tiny app for Windows PCs that automatically mutes your keyboard as you type to make conference calls a bit more distraction-free for others.

# Installation

You can either compile QuietKeys yourself or download the latest QuietKeysApp.exe from /Release.

# Other similar software

I'm aware of two other similar apps - neither work on windows, ergo - QuietKeys.
https://kryogenix.org/code/hushboard/ for Linux
https://unclack.app/ for Mac OS

And then there are fancier apps like https://krisp.ai/ that do more if you need it.
QuietKeys is simple, and free.

If you like the app, consider sharing some feedback on it at https://increment.me.
